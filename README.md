## gameplay
* *This game is a silly take on hangman based on an extremely unfunny pun*

* The user taps the space bar to begin, and once a round ends to begin a new round.

* Tap the keys to guess letters, if you succeed, they will fill out the spaces, if you fail, you will lose a remaining guess.

* Whether you win or lose, a screen will display telling you the correct word. It will also display a photo of the planet that was the wordto be guessed.  Your win or loss will be added to the record.

* During gameplay a "correct" and "incorrect" sound will play. A sound will play when you begin a new round by hitting the spacebar, and a different sound will play whether you win or lose. 

## development
* I'm treating this as a WIP, checkout the comments in the js document to see additional features I'm working on
    * I'm currently trying to have fact appear about the planet appear after the round is completed


## other info
* I am the sole maintainer of this code. 
* *note: please note the note about pluto before hassling me about it not being a planet anymore

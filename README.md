**Space: The Game**

##gameplay
* *This game is a silly take on hangman based on an extremely unfunny pun*

* The user taps the space bar to begin, and once a round ends to begin a new round

* Tap the keys to guess letters, if you succeed, they will fill out the spaces, if you fail, you will lose a remaining guess

* Whether you win or lose, a screen will display telling you the correct word. Your win or loss will be added to the record

##development
* I'm treating this as a WIP, checkout the comments in the js document to see additional features I'm working on
    * I'm trying to have a background image and a fact about the planet appear after the round is completed


##other info
* I am the sole maintainer of this code. 
* *note: please note the note about pluto before hassling me about it not being a planet anymore
